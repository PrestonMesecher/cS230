# CS230 Module Eight Journal

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted their game Draw It or Lose It to run on more than just Android, so I had to design it for multiple platforms.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I think I explained the main parts of the system pretty clearly so it was easier to understand.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It helped me plan ahead and think about problems before coding, which made things go smoother.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would add more detail in some sections to make things clearer. Some parts felt a little short and looking back, it would be helpful to have an abundance of information. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
They wanted the game on different platforms, so I made sure the design showed that. User needs are important because the software has to work for them as a customer/consumer, not just for the developer.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I broke things down into smaller parts and used diagrams to map it out. Next time I would do the same but try to add more detail where I can.
